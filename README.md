# yahtzee
more practice: yahtzee in js


## to do:
endgame reset option or...
...add a reset button that resets game at any time?

add a roll animation?

nicer display, cleaner code, etc.

implement yahtzee bonus? (need to look up rules for that)

multiple players?  -- make an AI player?

save high scores?
